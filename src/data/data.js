  paragraphOne: `I'm a 27 year old classical violist turned full stack developer, based out of Vancouver, BC.`,
  paragraphTwo: `I completed my Bachelor of Music degree from the University of Victoria in 2017 before moving to New York City, where I spent 3 years completing both my Master of Music degree and Professional Studies Certificate from one of the top music schools in North America: Manhattan School of Music. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I decided to pivot my career path to pursue software development, another passion of mine.`,
  paragraphThree: `Upon graduating with a Web Development Certificate from Lighthouse Labs in August 2020, I was quickly hired as a Full-Stack Developer at a fintech comapny called The Perk, where I've worked ever since primarily using JS, Node, React, GQL, and Docker. Coming from a background in music performance, I offer a unique skill set in team communication and collaboration, and can thrive both in new unfamiliar situations and under pressure.`,
